# Epic Meal Planner

Search for all kinds of recipes in order to organize your next meal, or five! Plan ahead for a healthier lifestyle by saving your favorite recipes and then adding them to breakfast, lunch, or dinner in your calendar that includes a weekly or daily view. From the recipe page, easily add all of the ingredients to your shopping list with the click of a button, or just add what you need straight to your list and modify as needed. You can check items off as you go, and there's also a convenient food categories page for when you want to quickly find a certain type of recipe.

Epic Meal Planner was the effort of a team of 6 developers: 3 front-end, 2 back-end, and 1 project manager. We collectively clocked in over 1,000 hours during the course of this project. Please note that the application is still under construction.
